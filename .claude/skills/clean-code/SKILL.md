skill: clean-code
description: >-
  A set of principles and practices for writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. The rules cover single responsibility, loose coupling, testability, naming, and extension, with guidelines on when to stop and ask for clarification. The goal is to keep the codebase clean and manageable over time.
---
## Working method

Every change must leave the codebase as clean or cleaner than you found it.
Clean code stays understandable, testable, and safe to change; sloppy code compounds and slows every future task.

The rules below are non-negotiable.

## Single responsibility

> One job per function. One reason to change per class.

- **Do** split a unit the moment it does two distinct things.
- **Do** separate business logic from I/O — calculation should not also read files or hit the network.
- **Don't** create "manager" / "processor" / "handler" classes that absorb everything.
- **Don't** use "and" in a function or class name.

## Loose coupling and dependency inversion

> Talk through narrow interfaces. Have dependencies handed in.

- **Do** accept dependencies via constructor or parameter so callers and tests can substitute them.
- **Do** put an interface between high-level logic and infrastructure (DB, HTTP, filesystem, clock).
- **Don't** call `new ConcreteService()` inside a class that uses it.
- **Don't** reach into another module's private state or introduce new shared mutable state.

## Testability

> If it can't be tested in isolation, it isn't designed yet.

- **Do** prefer pure functions: same inputs, same outputs, no side effects.
- **Do** test observable behaviour through public interfaces.
- **Do** inject test doubles for external dependencies; hide non-determinism (clock, randomness, env) behind seams.
- **Don't** write code that requires a real database, network, or filesystem to test.
- **Don't** tie tests to private methods or call order — refactoring internals must not break the suite.

## Naming and comments

> Names carry meaning. Comments explain *why*, never *what*.

- **Do** use names that reveal intent without needing a comment, in the project's domain language.
- **Do** keep comments that explain *why* — business constraints, non-obvious decisions, links to issues.
- **Don't** add comments that narrate what the code already says.
- **Don't** use cryptic abbreviations or encode types in names (`strName`, `iCount`).

## Open to extension

> Extend by adding code, not by editing working code.

- **Do** reach for polymorphism or a strategy pattern when a new case appears.
- **Do** keep things private by default; expose only what callers genuinely need.
- **Don't** grow `switch` or `if/else` chains for each new case.
- **Don't** change a public interface without flagging it — once exposed, it's a contract.

## When to stop and ask

Stop and ask the user before continuing if any of these is true:

- The task is ambiguous in a way that affects the design.
- The blast radius is larger than the task implied (touching unrelated modules, changing public interfaces, schema migrations).
- A test you didn't write is failing, and the cause isn't obviously related to your change.
- You're about to add a dependency, secret, or destructive operation (delete, drop, force-push, mass rewrite).
- You can't verify the change with the existing test/lint commands.

Don't ask for permission on routine work. Do ask before anything that's hard to undo.

## Done means

A change is done when **all** of the following are true:

- The stated task is satisfied — no more, no less.
- New behavior has tests; existing tests still pass.
- Lint and format checks pass.
- The diff is focused: no unrelated edits, no commented-out code, no debug prints.
- A reviewer reading the diff cold would not need to ask "why?" anywhere it isn't already answered.
